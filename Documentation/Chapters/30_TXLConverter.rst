TXLConverter
============

For existing TXL files, there is a command line interface script that converts them to SVG / HTML files.

Usage

The usage is very simple. Simply run the python script `TXLWizard/TXLConverterCLI.py`.
The command line interface will allow you to change the configuration as you wish. Furthermore, the configuration is saved
and restored for a subsequent run.
